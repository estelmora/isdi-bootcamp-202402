## Functional
Here‚Äôs how the service works:

- Landing Page: New users are greeted with a landing page that provides them with two options: to register as a new user or to log in if they already have an account.

- Register User: where new users can sign in, by providing some personal data such as: name, email, username, birthdate, and password. 

- Home Page: Once logged in, users are directed to the home page, whichwill be the hub from where all activities are carried out. A logout button is available for users to exit their accounts.

- Upload Files: Podcast creators can upload their podcast files either directly from their computer or through a link from various platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, Apple, etc.

- Analyze Files: After uploading, the files can be analyzed by a feature called WHISPER - IA, which listens to the podcast audio file, analyzes it, and creates transcripts. This is likely a speech-to-text functionality that allows for the podcast content to be converted into written form.

- Idea Generator: The service offers a creative tool that suggests trending topics and key words based on the content of the podcast and what's currently trending, to help podcast creators generate content that is relevant and has the potential to engage more listeners.
