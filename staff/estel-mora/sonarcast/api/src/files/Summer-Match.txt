Sweating in the summer heat, swiping left and right
Scrolling through the app, looking for other fields just right
Then I saw your profile pic, a spark ignited in my heart
I knew right then and there, you were the perfect scar
We met up for a date, butterflies dancing in my chest
The chemistry was electric, it was almost too good to be blessed
We laughed and talked for hours like we'd known each other for years
In that moment, I realized I had to overcome my fears
Summer by match, you're the fire that keeps me burning
Every day with you it feels like a lesson in yearning
From that tender flame, our love is no so strong
Fleece together, and I know it's never long
